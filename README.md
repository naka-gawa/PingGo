# PingGo

## Overview

PingGo is a Go-lang implementation of the classic ping utility, created for educational purposes. This project aims to provide a hands-on experience in network programming and to explore the concurrency features of Go through the development of a familiar network diagnostic tool. PingGo seeks to replicate the basic functionality of the traditional ping command, making it an excellent starting point for those looking to understand the fundamentals of networking and Go programming.

## Features

- Basic ICMP echo request and response mechanism, similar to traditional ping
- Command-line interface for easy use and parameters adjustment
- Cross-platform support, leveraging Go's capability to compile for different OS

## Installation

To get started with PingGo, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. For instructions on installing Go, visit [the official Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PingGo.git
cd PingGo
```

To build the tool, run:

```
go build
```

This will create an executable in your current directory.

## Usage

To use PingGo, simply run the executable from the command line. For example:

```
